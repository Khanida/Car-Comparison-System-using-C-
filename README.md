# Car Comparison System using C++ 
This project deals with the comparison among cars.  
C++ project I first-ever completed.

## Description
This project deals with the comparison among cars. It helps the user to select the best
car of their requirement according to their criteria.
The information is feed up on the source code which allows user to determine the
comparison between two cars of their criteria. This program is implemented in C++. The
source code is easy and simple through which the comparison between car is easily
determined. The case study discusses the use of simpler codes to build the abstraction.
In addition, this report will also discuss the strategies to concise the large set of data
in few numbers of lines.
The users can interact with the program by giving input of the car of their choice and
after execution the output gives comparison.
